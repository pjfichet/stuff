# Shell scripts

Here are kept safe some shell scripts that I find useful.

`book` is a simple addressbook.

`color` prints some colors in the terminal. That's useful to remind
about shell color codes and test the configuration of some terminal
emulators.

`fcul` displays the urls of some programs of the french radio France
Culture. 

`lorem` prints a lorem ipsum.

`lum` sets the backlight of my screen.

`mimer` display the mimetype of a file, in a format compatible with
`mhn` from mailutils-mu.

`ripdvd` uses mencoder to rip a dvd.

`showfont.sh` produces a pdf of a glyphs in a font, using heirloom
troff.

`translate.sh` searches in wordreference.com for some translation. It
must be renamed to actually work: `enfr`, for instance, will translate
from english to french.

`urldecode` a url decoder.

`ydl` is a wrapper for youtube-dl, which retrieves the url from the
X clipboard, download the video, and uses `mpv` to play it.

# installation

Edit the makefile and run `make install` to install.
